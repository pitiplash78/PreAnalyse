Description of PreAnalyseExtended:
------------------------------------------------
This graphical program is used for screening, modifying and analysis for linear time series in Geosciences and Physics. The data is organised in projects and sorted to work on different projects at different times. The screening and modifying is carried out graphical by using the mouse and keyboard for fast clean progress and direct visualisation of the result. For analysing the data several functions exists. The exchange of data between different users can simple carried out by export and import of the whole project. In the order, that each user has the same information and modified / analysed data, as the knowledge of their history.
The program is written in .NET C#, running natively in Windows in the .NET-environment. The program can run under Linux using the last version of Mono (4.5). The use in Linux is limited but should work.


Description of LaborLog:
---------------------------------
The program is a simple event logger for use in labs or similar facilities. It allows a fast effective documentation of done work in brief description. The option allows e-mail notification to inform related parties. 
The output of the program can also be used during time series analysis with PreAnalyseExtended for to get time relevant information according the time series.
